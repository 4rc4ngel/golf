          <small>28th May 2019</small>
          <p>
            Mixed feeling about our return to Brentwood, on the whole?? Everyone
            felt it was nice to return, but the move to Maylands has been good!!
          </p>
          <p>
            As most were back with higher HCs than last year there had been a
            lot of talk about 40 plus points...... We'll see!!
          </p>
          <p>
            We managed to achieve the goal of hitting all the NPs and only 6 of
            the 13 missed the charity green (18) A mention then to Dave P, Lee,
            Mark M and Rob, all taking an NP each this week. Well done gents!!
          </p>
          <p>
            It pains me to say that on a course we played for three years 10 of
            us didn't even manage 30 points, never mind 40!!!! So it's thanks to
            three others I have some good news to bring you. 33 for Rob who had
            an excellent round, despite a little wobble just after the turn.
            Sadly that wobble cost Rob runner up spot as he was beaten into
            third place on count back. Also carding 33 and just the one point
            better coming home was John F, well no NP this week so he wanted
            some glory!! Well done John, third in the table now.
          </p>
          <p>
            This weeks winner with an excellent round, including two birdies
            that were BOTH almost eagles!! Our clear leader after six weeks and
            setting the standard for the rest of us........ Nick!!!! Brilliant
            stuff!!
          </p>
          <p>
            In my opinion I enjoyed the return to Brentwood, it's quieter than
            Maylands, but I feel the overall experience of Maylands is better.
            So with this in mind, an annual return to Brentwood could be on the
            cards. We will have other away days later in the year, but in two
            weeks time we will be back to our new home.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for next week it's just up the road in Essex for a TLC day, all
            you going have a wonderful day.
          </p>
          <p>That's All Folks!!</p>

          </p>

          <p>
            From a casual round of golf in March 2013, John Farrow and myself
            came up with the idea of a regular Tuesday meet to accompany our
            monthly society days. The call was then put out on our Twitter
            accounts, to see if there was any interest among other members of
            the TLC Golf Society, that were Essex based. A couple of weeks later
            we had a tee booked for 8am on a Tuesday at Mardyke Valley Golf
            Course. Six people showed up, Chris Allen, Dave Clark, John Farrow,
            Jon Brewster, Mike Inns, and myself. So that began our regular
            Tuesday meet!!!
          </p>

          <p>
            John struck a deal with the secretary of Woolston Manor Golf Club
            and that became our home for the remainder of the year. Numbers
            began to grow, so we formulated a system to give us a competitive
            edge each week, culminating in a winner at the end of the season. On
            June 18th 2013 with a merry band of 20 golfers we lined up at
            Woolston Manor to play the first event of our Summer Competition. We
            ran until October 15th when Lee Spackman became the first ever
            champion of Tuesday Club.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our parting words were often “See you next Tuesday” and as needed a
            name for our group that felt as good as any………….. the
            CUNextTuesday’s were born!!
          </p>
          <p>
            The format has been amended slightly each year to try to keep the
            competition tight, this has most defiantly worked as every year has
            produced a winner on the final day and not before. Many of the
            original members I’m pleased to say are still with us, although as
            quick as one leaves, we have been fortunate to fill the hole with
            another.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016 we decided to have a change of scenery and moved to
            Brentwood Golf Club, this has been a great success with the course
            posing different problems to the ones faced at Woolston Manor. That
            season we introduced a Matchplay tournament which is organised
            brilliantly by Dave Clark. This has also proved popular and the
            first final was won by Martyn Stanley.
          </p>
          <p>
            April 2019 we move again, Maylands Golf Club this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            As organiser of this society I feel very proud of its success and
            pleased that we have a group of guys that get on socially. Although
            we are all competitive golfers I think that the off course banter is
            equally as important.
