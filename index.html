          <p>
            Well less is more!!!! An elite band of six took on the potential
            thunder and lightening, armed with our 1 irons. As we know, not even
            God can hit a 1 iron :-)
          </p>
          <p>
            Result? No rain just a muggy morning with a little sunshine.
          </p>
          <p>
            James, Lee and Rob set us off and all came home with scores that
            suggest they are golfers of a reasonable standard. Group two,
            however had one golfer and two players fit to wear the shirts of our
            society!!!!!!
          </p>
          <p>
            A 30 for James puts him into fourth place, whilst Lee leaps to the
            top of the tree with his 32. Both decent but not in the money, Rob
            was sitting in the club house proudly with a 36 (17-19) hoping it
            would be enough. Alas no, as someone else had other ideas!!
          </p>
          <p>
            It was very fitting and also very enjoyable to watch, as Martyn, who
            has decided to leave the taxi trade and venture back into his
            previous life in recruitment, had a round to remember.
          </p>
          <p>
            Four or five birdie chances, with only one taken he then hit a
            monster drive on 17 followed by a wonderful fairway shot that
            nestled on the green around 6-7 foot from the hole. His eagle putt
            looked in all the way but sadly just lipped out to leave a tap in
            for birdie number two. Another monster drive on the last saw him
            finish with par and sign off in style.
          </p>
          <p>
            37 points (16-21) is a score worthy of any winner in this group. We
            will sadly not be seeing Martyn's cheery face very often on a
            Tuesday morning any more, but I'm sure I speak for everyone when I
            say..... Good Luck my friend, and come back to see us any time you
            want!!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm sure you are all wondering about the other two? Well Dave C had
            a Basil Faulty moment when he gave his golf bag "A damn good
            thrashing" and I managed to have some wonderful practice shots on my
            chip shots, only to thin them all through the green!!!!!
          </p>
          <p>On to other matters............</p>
          <p>
            As you know we always have a Charity Day and this year it will be on
            30th July (not next week as previously advertised) The charity will
            be chosen by our current champ Chris P and will also receive the
            money from our weekly collection. The committee would love to see as
            many members as possible so we can raise a few quid and have a fun
            morning, shall we make it a hat day again?
          </p>
          <p>
            We will play Texas Scramble and will try to organise groups to split
            HCs. So I'd love to get a feel of those that will be able to attend,
            or at least know the ones that will DEFINITELY not be able to
            attend.
          </p>
          <p>Please let me know.</p>
          <p>That's All Folks!!</p>

          <p>
            From a casual round of golf in March 2013, John Farrow and myself
            came up with the idea of a regular Tuesday meet to accompany our
            monthly society days. The call was then put out on our Twitter
            accounts, to see if there was any interest among other members of
            the TLC Golf Society, that were Essex based. A couple of weeks later
            we had a tee booked for 8am on a Tuesday at Mardyke Valley Golf
            Course. Six people showed up, Chris Allen, Dave Clark, John Farrow,
            Jon Brewster, Mike Inns, and myself. So that began our regular
            Tuesday meet!!!
          </p>

          <p>
            John struck a deal with the secretary of Woolston Manor Golf Club
            and that became our home for the remainder of the year. Numbers
            began to grow, so we formulated a system to give us a competitive
            edge each week, culminating in a winner at the end of the season. On
            June 18th 2013 with a merry band of 20 golfers we lined up at
            Woolston Manor to play the first event of our Summer Competition. We
            ran until October 15th when Lee Spackman became the first ever
            champion of Tuesday Club.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our parting words were often “See you next Tuesday” and as needed a
            name for our group that felt as good as any………….. the
            CUNextTuesday’s were born!!
          </p>
          <p>
            The format has been amended slightly each year to try to keep the
            competition tight, this has most defiantly worked as every year has
            produced a winner on the final day and not before. Many of the
            original members I’m pleased to say are still with us, although as
            quick as one leaves, we have been fortunate to fill the hole with
            another.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016 we decided to have a change of scenery and moved to
            Brentwood Golf Club, this has been a great success with the course
            posing different problems to the ones faced at Woolston Manor. That
            season we introduced a Matchplay tournament which is organised
            brilliantly by Dave Clark. This has also proved popular and the
            first final was won by Martyn Stanley.
          </p>
          <p>
            April 2019 we move again, Maylands Golf Club this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            As organiser of this society I feel very proud of its success and
            pleased that we have a group of guys that get on socially. Although
            we are all competitive golfers I think that the off course banter is
            equally as important.
