          <h4>The Final Week</h4>
          <small>30th November 2018</small>
          <p>
            So we reach the end of another fabulous year, it was great that we
            had a good attendance for the final day with 15 of us.
          </p>
          <p>
            We thought it would be a three horse race but sadly Chris A couldn't
            make it, due to his wife Marie being unwell. Wishing her a speedy
            recovery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul from the pro shop kindly put up a box of balls for the four NPs
            and they were won by Gary, Martyn, Rob and John F. The overall
            winner for the season was once again John F, well done John!!
          </p>
          <p>
            On to the main event, I went out with the two leaders John F and
            Chris P,we also had Dave C who, like me, had an outside chance of
            catching them.
          </p>
          <p>
            After 3 holes that small hope for Dave and I had evaporated, but
            Chris and John were both on 6 points already. The next few holes saw
            them both wobble a bit under the pressure and drop shots. On the
            sixth John left his approach shot short and lost it in the bushes
            left of the pond. It was a chance for Chris but he then went and put
            his into the water.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we stood on the ninth tee and only Chris could improve his
            seasons score, he needed par. A poor tee shot put paid to that as he
            went on to bogey the hole.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tenth proved to be a pivotal hole. John safely on in three saw
            his birdie putt graze the right side of the cup. Chris was in the
            green side bunker for three and played out beautifully, his ball
            rolled down the bank, up the green and straight in the hole...
            Birdie!! He then parred the eleventh and looked to be on his way,
            surely John couldn't push back at him now.
          </p>
          <p>
            John dug deep and refused to give up, and when Chris increased his
            score with a par on 15 to go four in front, John hit back on 16 to
            close the gap to 3!!
          </p>
          <p>
            So Chris just needs to hold his nerve on 17 and he should be over
            the line. It suddenly looked like he may crumble, as his tee shot
            hit a tree on the left and came back near the tee. Chris then went
            on to put his ball out of bounds. John smelt blood and went all out
            for it. Knowing a par would put him to one shot of Chris. A ten foot
            par putt rattled into the cup and John punched the air.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once again a whole season has come down to the last hole, John teed
            off first with all the other members watching on. His ball safely on
            the green, Chris just needs to hold his nerve. He decided on his
            driver for the long par three, and a big cheer went up when he
            played it just off the left side of the green.
          </p>
          <p>
            So Chris needs a four to win, his putt on to the green left him 8
            foot. He rolled it up to the hole a tapped in to become
            CUNextTuesday 2018 champion!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Back in the club house we handed out prizes to John F for both
            runner up and NP champ. Marc R was the surprised winner of most
            improved and the absent Chris A was awarded the third place trophy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dave C, as last years winner, had the pleasure of handing the trophy
            over to an emotional Chris. A very touching speech, in which Chris
            dedicated the victory to his late wife Ann, had the whole group
            close to tears!!
          </p>
          <p>
            All in all, a worthy winner and a very gracious runner up. What a
            day!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly I'd like to thank you all for supporting me all season,
            without you there it don't work. Also for getting me a little gift,
            it will be well spent. Any suggestions for improvement next season
            please message me personally and I'll put them to the committee.
          </p>
          <p>Thank you all have a great winter!!</p>
          <p>Andy</p>

        <div>
          <p>
            From a casual round of golf in March 2013, John Farrow and myself
            came up with the idea of a regular Tuesday meet to accompany our
            monthly society days. The call was then put out on our Twitter
            accounts, to see if there was any interest among other members of
            the TLC Golf Society, that were Essex based. A couple of weeks later
            we had a tee booked for 8am on a Tuesday at Mardyke Valley Golf
            Course. Six people showed up, Chris Allen, Dave Clark, John Farrow,
            Jon Brewster, Mike Inns, and myself. So that began our regular
            Tuesday meet!!!
          </p>

          <p>
            John struck a deal with the secretary of Woolston Manor Golf Club
            and that became our home for the remainder of the year. Numbers
            began to grow, so we formulated a system to give us a competitive
            edge each week, culminating in a winner at the end of the season. On
            June 18th 2013 with a merry band of 20 golfers we lined up at
            Woolston Manor to play the first event of our Summer Competition. We
            ran until October 15th when Lee Spackman became the first ever
            champion of Tuesday Club.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our parting words were often “See you next Tuesday” and as needed a
            name for our group that felt as good as any………….. the
            CUNextTuesday’s were born!!
          </p>
          <p>
            The format has been amended slightly each year to try to keep the
            competition tight, this has most defiantly worked as every year has
            produced a winner on the final day and not before. Many of the
            original members I’m pleased to say are still with us, although as
            quick as one leaves, we have been fortunate to fill the hole with
            another.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016 we decided to have a change of scenery and moved to
            Brentwood Golf Club, this has been a great success with the course
            posing different problems to the ones faced at Woolston Manor. That
            season we introduced a Matchplay tournament which is organised
            brilliantly by Dave Clark. This has also proved popular and the
            first final was won by Martyn Stanley.
          </p>
          <p>
            April 2019 we move again, Maylands Golf Club this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            As organiser of this society I feel very proud of its success and
            pleased that we have a group of guys that get on socially. Although
            we are all competitive golfers I think that the off course banter is
            equally as important.
