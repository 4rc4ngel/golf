          <p>
            Sorry I once again couldn't be there this week, but money had to
            come first!! A lower turn out than the last couple of weeks of nine
            went out in 3 balls, on a glorious morning. All the NPs were hit,
            Dave C got his first of the season and Stu his second. As for the
            usual suspect..... John F took his tally for the season to six with
            a double. Well done you three!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of you coming in with good steady scores as you start to get
            accustomed to our new surroundings. To go with his good shots on the
            par threes, John F managed a very good 30 points. Joining him on
            that number was early leader Nick, well done gents but just outside
            of the money this week. The honours at the top fell to two others
            also on the same score of 32. James being Mr Steady this week with
            16-16 only to be beaten on count back by Stu with his 20 on the
            back. Well played everyone and Stu you're..... Champ for a week!!!
            :-)
          </p>

          <h2><span class="text-primary">Match</span> Play</h2>

          <p>
            Only one MP this week and the battle between Rob and Dave P finished
            all square after a fight back by Rob. Spoiling 'Dave's birthday' Rob
            was chuffed to say!!!
          </p>

          <h2><span class="text-primary">Important</span> Notice</h2>

          <p>
            One final thing to let you all know, next week (14th May) we will be
            doing our first away day of the season. This will be at our old home
            of Brentwood. 8.00 tee as usual, but the cost will be slightly
            dearer at £25. This does include your lunch though. We arranged this
            so anyone with vouchers from last season can bring them along. We
            don't just throw this gig together you know!!!
          </p>

          <p>That's all Folks</p>

          <p>
            From a casual round of golf in March 2013, John Farrow and myself
            came up with the idea of a regular Tuesday meet to accompany our
            monthly society days. The call was then put out on our Twitter
            accounts, to see if there was any interest among other members of
            the TLC Golf Society, that were Essex based. A couple of weeks later
            we had a tee booked for 8am on a Tuesday at Mardyke Valley Golf
            Course. Six people showed up, Chris Allen, Dave Clark, John Farrow,
            Jon Brewster, Mike Inns, and myself. So that began our regular
            Tuesday meet!!!
          </p>

          <p>
            John struck a deal with the secretary of Woolston Manor Golf Club
            and that became our home for the remainder of the year. Numbers
            began to grow, so we formulated a system to give us a competitive
            edge each week, culminating in a winner at the end of the season. On
            June 18th 2013 with a merry band of 20 golfers we lined up at
            Woolston Manor to play the first event of our Summer Competition. We
            ran until October 15th when Lee Spackman became the first ever
            champion of Tuesday Club.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our parting words were often “See you next Tuesday” and as needed a
            name for our group that felt as good as any………….. the
            CUNextTuesday’s were born!!
          </p>
          <p>
            The format has been amended slightly each year to try to keep the
            competition tight, this has most defiantly worked as every year has
            produced a winner on the final day and not before. Many of the
            original members I’m pleased to say are still with us, although as
            quick as one leaves, we have been fortunate to fill the hole with
            another.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016 we decided to have a change of scenery and moved to
            Brentwood Golf Club, this has been a great success with the course
            posing different problems to the ones faced at Woolston Manor. That
            season we introduced a Matchplay tournament which is organised
            brilliantly by Dave Clark. This has also proved popular and the
            first final was won by Martyn Stanley.
          </p>
          <p>
            April 2019 we move again, Maylands Golf Club this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            As organiser of this society I feel very proud of its success and
            pleased that we have a group of guys that get on socially. Although
            we are all competitive golfers I think that the off course banter is
            equally as important.
