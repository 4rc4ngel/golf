          <h4>Week 2</h4>
          <small>9th April 2019</small>
          <p>
            Due to Easter holidays starting for many, PG Tips golf on Thursday
            and the weather threatening to soak us for most of the morning, we
            had low numbers this week. Just eight of us in fact, but what a
            jolly eight we were. Especially as for the most part the rain held
            off for us.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was also an opportunity to give a warm welcome to our newest
            member Stuart, straight in with a MP against Lee, Chris A and myself
            were also in the group, ready to ridicule him given the chance!!
            Baptism by fire indeed :-) Although Chris did spend much of the
            morning on his own, discovering different parts of the golf course!!
          </p>
          <p>
            All the NPs hit this week and new-boy Stuart grabbed one along with
            Lee, John M and Nick. Well done all of you!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Big scores were not on the agenda at all and the field was squashed
            between 24 & 29 points. Respectable 27s for Stuart and the two
            John's, Mac and Farrow. Runner up for the second week running with
            28 was Lee and this weeks champ receiving a harsh cut for winning on
            29 was Nick. A great back nine only two over and scoring 18 points.
            Good golf Nick!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Two MPs took place to start us off, John F beat Dave C 2 & 1 and
            Stuart completed a decent introduction to life as at the
            CUNextTuesday's with a victory over Lee on the 18th. 1 up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lee is looking like this years runner up in every sense of the word,
            whats the odds on that?
          </p>

          <p>
            I did try to help Lee by thinning one on the 18th fairway that
            almost took Stuart's ankles out!!! Boy did he jump quick :-)
          </p>
          <p>
            All those going to PG Tips have a great day out, I hope to see you
            all next week.
          </p>
          <p>That's all Folks</p>

          <p>
            From a casual round of golf in March 2013, John Farrow and myself
            came up with the idea of a regular Tuesday meet to accompany our
            monthly society days. The call was then put out on our Twitter
            accounts, to see if there was any interest among other members of
            the TLC Golf Society, that were Essex based. A couple of weeks later
            we had a tee booked for 8am on a Tuesday at Mardyke Valley Golf
            Course. Six people showed up, Chris Allen, Dave Clark, John Farrow,
            Jon Brewster, Mike Inns, and myself. So that began our regular
            Tuesday meet!!!
          </p>

          <p>
            John struck a deal with the secretary of Woolston Manor Golf Club
            and that became our home for the remainder of the year. Numbers
            began to grow, so we formulated a system to give us a competitive
            edge each week, culminating in a winner at the end of the season. On
            June 18th 2013 with a merry band of 20 golfers we lined up at
            Woolston Manor to play the first event of our Summer Competition. We
            ran until October 15th when Lee Spackman became the first ever
            champion of Tuesday Club.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our parting words were often “See you next Tuesday” and as needed a
            name for our group that felt as good as any………….. the
            CUNextTuesday’s were born!!
          </p>
          <p>
            The format has been amended slightly each year to try to keep the
            competition tight, this has most defiantly worked as every year has
            produced a winner on the final day and not before. Many of the
            original members I’m pleased to say are still with us, although as
            quick as one leaves, we have been fortunate to fill the hole with
            another.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016 we decided to have a change of scenery and moved to
            Brentwood Golf Club, this has been a great success with the course
            posing different problems to the ones faced at Woolston Manor. That
            season we introduced a Matchplay tournament which is organised
            brilliantly by Dave Clark. This has also proved popular and the
            first final was won by Martyn Stanley.
          </p>
          <p>
            April 2019 we move again, Maylands Golf Club this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            As organiser of this society I feel very proud of its success and
            pleased that we have a group of guys that get on socially. Although
            we are all competitive golfers I think that the off course banter is
            equally as important.
