          <h4>Week 4</h4>
          <small>23th April 2019</small>
          <p>
            After a beautiful Easter weekend the weather had cooled a little for
            our Tuesday bash. Unfortunately I was unable to attend so a big
            thanks to Dave C and Chris A for looking after the procedure.
          </p>
          <p>
            A good number of thirteen once again and I'm pleased to report that
            for the second week running 10 of you failed to hit the green on the
            16th and therefore contributed £1 into our charity fund!!
          </p>
          <p>
            As I know little of who did what I'll get straight on to the
            important bits..... All NPs hit, one each for John F and Dan with a
            double coming in for our 2018 champ, Chris P. Well done all of you!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Bizarrely enough for the second week running we had a three way tie
            for the runner up slot. Scruffs buddies Stu and John F both carded a
            very good 30, only to be outdone by the returning Rob. Also on 30
            (13-17) just nicking it with his superior back nine. Champ for the
            week is the in form bridesmaid, now been promoted to the bride with
            his excellent 33 (16-17) cut to 13.9 next time out. Well played
            Lee!!! Puts himself on the top of the table after only four weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hopefully you all had an enjoyable morning but I'm sure the biggest
            grin of the day was on the face of Dan when he realised his seasons
            low score had been beaten. Let's not mention any names of who it was
            as poor Jmac has been playing well lately!!!
          </p>

          <h2><span class="text-primary">Match</span> Play</h2>

          <p>
            From a casual round of golf in March 2013, John Farrow and myself
            came up with the idea of a regular Tuesday meet to accompany our
            monthly society days. The call was then put out on our Twitter
            accounts, to see if there was any interest among other members of
            the TLC Golf Society, that were Essex based. A couple of weeks later
            we had a tee booked for 8am on a Tuesday at Mardyke Valley Golf
            Course. Six people showed up, Chris Allen, Dave Clark, John Farrow,
            Jon Brewster, Mike Inns, and myself. So that began our regular
            Tuesday meet!!!
          </p>

          <p>
            John struck a deal with the secretary of Woolston Manor Golf Club
            and that became our home for the remainder of the year. Numbers
            began to grow, so we formulated a system to give us a competitive
            edge each week, culminating in a winner at the end of the season. On
            June 18th 2013 with a merry band of 20 golfers we lined up at
            Woolston Manor to play the first event of our Summer Competition. We
            ran until October 15th when Lee Spackman became the first ever
            champion of Tuesday Club.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our parting words were often “See you next Tuesday” and as needed a
            name for our group that felt as good as any………….. the
            CUNextTuesday’s were born!!
          </p>
          <p>
            The format has been amended slightly each year to try to keep the
            competition tight, this has most defiantly worked as every year has
            produced a winner on the final day and not before. Many of the
            original members I’m pleased to say are still with us, although as
            quick as one leaves, we have been fortunate to fill the hole with
            another.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016 we decided to have a change of scenery and moved to
            Brentwood Golf Club, this has been a great success with the course
            posing different problems to the ones faced at Woolston Manor. That
            season we introduced a Matchplay tournament which is organised
            brilliantly by Dave Clark. This has also proved popular and the
            first final was won by Martyn Stanley.
          </p>
          <p>
            April 2019 we move again, Maylands Golf Club this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            As organiser of this society I feel very proud of its success and
            pleased that we have a group of guys that get on socially. Although
            we are all competitive golfers I think that the off course banter is
            equally as important.
