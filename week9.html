          <small>11th June 2019</small>
          <p>
            Numbers are surely down this year, for whatever reason. Those that
            haven't been much this year it would be nice to hear from you
            regarding any intended attendance. Not having a dig, just be nice to
            hear from you as we all miss you :-)
          </p>
          <p>
            So it was just 8 of us on a lovely morning for golf, after the
            previous days rain the course was looking great and the greens held
            up nicely. Didn't they John F?
          </p>
          <p>
            Two four balls and mine went off first, champ Lee set us off and
            unfortunately wasn't on the ball this week. A bit like me!!!
          </p>
          <p>
            All the NPs were hit, James getting his second of the season and
            Nick being rather greedy by taking the other three. Well done you
            two!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Half the field managed to get in the 30s, I don't say that very
            often. Three of them not in my group so I can only comment in detail
            on one. Kingsley carded an excellent 33 (17-16) but the runner up
            spot was fought out by James and league leader Nick. James taking
            the money on last six hole countback, as both came in with 34
            (16-18) Well played you three.
          </p>
          <p>
            This weeks champ played excellent stuff from tee to green all the
            way round. With long drives and good iron play, the final shot to
            the 18th green was superb. A drive down the left, just short of OB
            left a difficult iron over the trees. The ball pitched and stopped
            10 foot from the pin!! Brilliant golf John F and a worthy winner
            after that shot!!!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Next week sees The North pitted against The South in the annual TLC
            Ryder Cup, all those playing I wish you the best of luck (except
            Rob)
          </p>
          <p>See you all on the 25th June.</p>

          <p>That's All Folks!!</p>

          <p>
            From a casual round of golf in March 2013, John Farrow and myself
            came up with the idea of a regular Tuesday meet to accompany our
            monthly society days. The call was then put out on our Twitter
            accounts, to see if there was any interest among other members of
            the TLC Golf Society, that were Essex based. A couple of weeks later
            we had a tee booked for 8am on a Tuesday at Mardyke Valley Golf
            Course. Six people showed up, Chris Allen, Dave Clark, John Farrow,
            Jon Brewster, Mike Inns, and myself. So that began our regular
            Tuesday meet!!!
          </p>

          <p>
            John struck a deal with the secretary of Woolston Manor Golf Club
            and that became our home for the remainder of the year. Numbers
            began to grow, so we formulated a system to give us a competitive
            edge each week, culminating in a winner at the end of the season. On
            June 18th 2013 with a merry band of 20 golfers we lined up at
            Woolston Manor to play the first event of our Summer Competition. We
            ran until October 15th when Lee Spackman became the first ever
            champion of Tuesday Club.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our parting words were often “See you next Tuesday” and as needed a
            name for our group that felt as good as any………….. the
            CUNextTuesday’s were born!!
          </p>
          <p>
            The format has been amended slightly each year to try to keep the
            competition tight, this has most defiantly worked as every year has
            produced a winner on the final day and not before. Many of the
            original members I’m pleased to say are still with us, although as
            quick as one leaves, we have been fortunate to fill the hole with
            another.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016 we decided to have a change of scenery and moved to
            Brentwood Golf Club, this has been a great success with the course
            posing different problems to the ones faced at Woolston Manor. That
            season we introduced a Matchplay tournament which is organised
            brilliantly by Dave Clark. This has also proved popular and the
            first final was won by Martyn Stanley.
          </p>
          <p>
            April 2019 we move again, Maylands Golf Club this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            As organiser of this society I feel very proud of its success and
            pleased that we have a group of guys that get on socially. Although
            we are all competitive golfers I think that the off course banter is
            equally as important.
