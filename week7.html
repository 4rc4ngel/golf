          <h4>Week 7</h4>
          <small>28th May 2019</small>
          <p>
            It's not often we welcome guests along to our little get together,
            but when a former champ calls and asks if he can pop along to see
            everyone how can we refuse? So it was a pleasure to see Nicky Hunt
            back on the fairways. Well I 4-1 thought so!!
          </p>
          <p>
            So along with Nick there were 11 members on a lovely day for golf,
            dry, clear and a bit of sunshine. not all the NPs were hit but
            Tenerife Bob went very close on the 16th to claim that one.
            Returning from injury..... once again, Graham managed to hit two
            others. Well done you two!! Just to recap, 4 NPs, 1 not hit
          </p>
          <p>
            We went out in three balls and made very good time, even though we
            sent off Dave C and John F in the first group!!! My group didn't
            waste much time in the trees and bushes looking for balls, although
            I did see John M looking 4-1
          </p>
          <p>
            Only two players managed to get into the thirty's, Graham surprised
            himself, and no one else, how well he played. 16 out and 15 home
            giving him an excellent 31 and runner up spot to go with those two
            NPs. This weeks champ has now been the top 1-4 four weeks of the
            seven. An incredible feat for Nick R, he is now cut to 3.3 for next
            weeks meeting after getting 33 (16-17).
          </p>
          <p>
            Well played you two, and as Nick put it, he keeps winning because
            the rest of us are not putting in many 30 plus scores!!! Come on
            lads, rise to the challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought it would be unkind of me to say anything about the midweek
            cup final as I think the Arsenal fans outnumber me in this group by
            about 4/1
          </p>

          <p>That's All Folks!!</p>
          <p>

          <p>
            From a casual round of golf in March 2013, John Farrow and myself
            came up with the idea of a regular Tuesday meet to accompany our
            monthly society days. The call was then put out on our Twitter
            accounts, to see if there was any interest among other members of
            the TLC Golf Society, that were Essex based. A couple of weeks later
            we had a tee booked for 8am on a Tuesday at Mardyke Valley Golf
            Course. Six people showed up, Chris Allen, Dave Clark, John Farrow,
            Jon Brewster, Mike Inns, and myself. So that began our regular
            Tuesday meet!!!
          </p>

          <p>
            John struck a deal with the secretary of Woolston Manor Golf Club
            and that became our home for the remainder of the year. Numbers
            began to grow, so we formulated a system to give us a competitive
            edge each week, culminating in a winner at the end of the season. On
            June 18th 2013 with a merry band of 20 golfers we lined up at
            Woolston Manor to play the first event of our Summer Competition. We
            ran until October 15th when Lee Spackman became the first ever
            champion of Tuesday Club.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our parting words were often “See you next Tuesday” and as needed a
            name for our group that felt as good as any………….. the
            CUNextTuesday’s were born!!
          </p>
          <p>
            The format has been amended slightly each year to try to keep the
            competition tight, this has most defiantly worked as every year has
            produced a winner on the final day and not before. Many of the
            original members I’m pleased to say are still with us, although as
            quick as one leaves, we have been fortunate to fill the hole with
            another.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016 we decided to have a change of scenery and moved to
            Brentwood Golf Club, this has been a great success with the course
            posing different problems to the ones faced at Woolston Manor. That
            season we introduced a Matchplay tournament which is organised
            brilliantly by Dave Clark. This has also proved popular and the
            first final was won by Martyn Stanley.
          </p>
          <p>
            April 2019 we move again, Maylands Golf Club this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            As organiser of this society I feel very proud of its success and
            pleased that we have a group of guys that get on socially. Although
            we are all competitive golfers I think that the off course banter is
            equally as important.
