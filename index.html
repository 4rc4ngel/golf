          <h4>Week 1</h4>
          <small>2nd April 2019</small>
          <p>
            It was lovely to see everyone today for our first event of the year.
            14 of us turned up on a fine morning that threatened to rain on us a
            couple of times, but gladly held up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chris P set us off as last years champ and rolled in later with a
            score that suggests he could challenge once again. The course itself
            was in decent condition for early April and everyone seemed happy
            with our new home. The food is decent but no Scampigate I'm afraid
            :-)
          </p>
          <p>
            I would like to thank you all for completing the score cards as
            requested and your patience with us getting the paperwork done. To
            be fair I think it went quite well at the first attempt..... not our
            usual shambles!!!!
          </p>
          <p>
            We only managed three of the four par threes and John F set off in
            his pursuit of his annual trophy, only to be outdone by Martyn who
            managed two on the opening day. Well done you two!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Big scores on the opening day were scarce but a few in the thirty's
            to report on, Kingsley opened his account with a very good 30, 32
            for both Nick R and runner up on countback Lee. That left double NP
            man Martyn, out on his own with 33 points (20-13) under our new
            system he receives a cut of 1.5 and will be off 13 next week!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh...... I nearly forgot Dan, he scored an incredible 66!!!!
          </p>

          <p>
            Matchplay matches to start next week, the top two in each group will
            progress to the knock out stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's All Folks!!!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Andy
          </p>
          <p>
            PS: I've just rechecked and noticed Dan scored 6 & 6..... but he
            reliably informed me it's his second best score at Maylands :-))

          <p>
            From a casual round of golf in March 2013, John Farrow and myself
            came up with the idea of a regular Tuesday meet to accompany our
            monthly society days. The call was then put out on our Twitter
            accounts, to see if there was any interest among other members of
            the TLC Golf Society, that were Essex based. A couple of weeks later
            we had a tee booked for 8am on a Tuesday at Mardyke Valley Golf
            Course. Six people showed up, Chris Allen, Dave Clark, John Farrow,
            Jon Brewster, Mike Inns, and myself. So that began our regular
            Tuesday meet!!!
          </p>

          <p>
            John struck a deal with the secretary of Woolston Manor Golf Club
            and that became our home for the remainder of the year. Numbers
            began to grow, so we formulated a system to give us a competitive
            edge each week, culminating in a winner at the end of the season. On
            June 18th 2013 with a merry band of 20 golfers we lined up at
            Woolston Manor to play the first event of our Summer Competition. We
            ran until October 15th when Lee Spackman became the first ever
            champion of Tuesday Club.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our parting words were often “See you next Tuesday” and as needed a
            name for our group that felt as good as any………….. the
            CUNextTuesday’s were born!!
          </p>
          <p>
            The format has been amended slightly each year to try to keep the
            competition tight, this has most defiantly worked as every year has
            produced a winner on the final day and not before. Many of the
            original members I’m pleased to say are still with us, although as
            quick as one leaves, we have been fortunate to fill the hole with
            another.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016 we decided to have a change of scenery and moved to
            Brentwood Golf Club, this has been a great success with the course
            posing different problems to the ones faced at Woolston Manor. That
            season we introduced a Matchplay tournament which is organised
            brilliantly by Dave Clark. This has also proved popular and the
            first final was won by Martyn Stanley.
          </p>
          <p>
            April 2019 we move again, Maylands Golf Club this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            As organiser of this society I feel very proud of its success and
            pleased that we have a group of guys that get on socially. Although
            we are all competitive golfers I think that the off course banter is
            equally as important.
